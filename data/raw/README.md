## Data Sources
### NASA CMR

NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is a high-performance, high-quality, continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs all data and service metadata records for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) and will be the authoritative management system for all EOSDIS metadata. You can obtain any NASA owned publicly available dataset on CMR and can read further about CMR and the CMR API for downloading data using the links below.

### Worldview
NASA Worldview is an interactive web application that provides over 900 global, full-resolution satellite imagery observations which are updated daily. Users can also get location and time information of some earth science events such as wildfires, volcanoes, algal blooms, etc. 

### Earthdata Search

[Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search)

NASAâ€™s CMR forms the backbone of a NASA data search engine called Earthdata search. Using this service, you can find satellite datasets and filter them by parameters such as science keywords, dates, platforms and instruments, data format, location, and much more. Using Earthdata search, it will be convenient to find the NASA datasets that you may wish to include for training your model for detecting your chosen phenomena. 


### AWS GOES 16/17

GOES satellites (GOES-16 & GOES-17) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provide continuous weather imagery and monitoring of meteorological and space environment data across North America. GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. Since they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they are able to provide consistent imagery for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hailstorms, and hurricanes. 

The ABI sensor hosted in the satellite provides 5-minute raw observations of Continental US (CONUS). These files are stored in compressed NETCDF formats and can be accessed through AWS S3 buckets. Further information about the bucket is available [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/). The raw files need to be processed for obtaining RGB images. Using the links provided, you will be able to access GOES datasets and incorporate them in your phenomena detection models.

### GIBS Worldview

Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) provides over 900 datasets of globally available NASA satellite imagery in full resolution. The satellite imagery can be rendered in your own web client or GIS application. The links below provide the extended description and a sample script to download GIBS imagery respectively.

### Image Labeler documentation and website

The Image Labeler is an interactive application created by the development team at NASA IMPACT designed to help users generate tagged images for machine learning. Images can be uploaded directly, or users can extract images from an interactive satellite map. Labeled images can also be downloaded for training your detection model.

NASA provides a plethora of free data. These data are collected from different sources including but 
not limited to satellites, instruments deployed at various places and in some cases, even manually collected.

Next we will be presenting a few places from where these data can be extracted

**Common Metadata Repository (CMR)**: 
Metadata is information about the actual data. They allow faster data searching and extraction. 
A very close analogy of this would be a video search based on various metadata of that video like 
name of the video, actors starring in the video, and so on.

According to [Earthdata, CMR search](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), CMR is a high-performance, high-quality, continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs Earth Science data and associated service metadata records. These metadata records are registered, modified, discovered, and accessed through programmatic interfaces leveraging standard protocols and APIs

[CMR Search](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) is an API interface that allows the users to make a very customizable search based on different query parameters.
The [API documentation](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html) contains a comprehensive guide on how to use the CMR API.
Some example python scripts of how to use the query can be found in the folder that contains this readme file.

**Earthdata Search**:
[Earthdata search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) enables the user to be able to search for the earthdata collected by NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) over the period of 30 years. The website also contains a comprehensive guide on how to use the website in the [getting started](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/getting-started) and the [learn](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn) section.

In addition to this, Earthdata also allows visualization of the data via [Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/). According to Worldview, it allows the users to visually explore the past and the present of this dynamic planet from a satellite's perspective.

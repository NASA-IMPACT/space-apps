# Pre-Labeled Datasets
This document provides example phenomena which have labeled datasets on ImageLabeler. You may choose to use any of the provided phenomena for your detection model.

## Transverse Cirrus Bands (TCB) 

Bands of clouds oriented perpendicular to the flow in which they are embedded. They often are seen best on satellite photographs. When observed at high altitudes, they may indicate extreme turbulence which is often a warning sign for severe weather. A labeled dataset of TCBs is available on ImageLabeler using the link below.

## Cloud streets

Cloud streets are shown to be significant to the vertical transport of momentum, heat, moisture, and air pollutants within the atmosphere. However, there is a lack of understanding of their development processes due to a lack of observational data. The link to the labeled dataset on ImageLabeler is provided below.

## High Latitude Dust

High latitude atmospheric dust consists of a mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere varying in composition, source and size. Dust itself can be a boon or a bane. Dust from the Sahara desert provides nutrition to the Amazon rainforest. However, dust storms and transport can cause extensive societal impacts so detecting them is extremely important. ImageLabeler has a labeled dataset of dust which you may use for your detection model.


## Smoke

Smoke from events such as wildfires, volcanoes, and industrial pollution cause numerous health impacts. ImageLabeler has a labeled dataset of smoke which you may use for your detection model. The training and validation folders can be found using the link provided. The files are in the .tif and .bmp formats.

## Air quality data

Air Quality (AQ) data is important for health and environmental research and policy purposes. 
CSV formatted data and labels
Contains PM2.5, GOES 16 AOD, HRRR T, RH, U and V winds, and PBL height

This document provides example phenomena which have labeled datasets on ImageLabeler. You may choose to use any of the provided phenomena for your detection model.

### Transverse Cirrus Bands (TCB) 

Bands of clouds oriented perpendicular to the flow in which they are embedded. They often are seen best on satellite photographs. When observed at high levels (i.e., in cirrus formations), they may indicate severe or extreme turbulence. A labeled dataset of TCBs is available on ImageLabeler using the link below.

### Dust

Atmospheric dust consists of a mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere varying in composition, source and size. Dust itself can be a boon or a bane. Dust from the Sahara desert provides nutrition to the Amazon rainforest. However, dust storms cause extensive societal impacts so detecting them is extremely important. ImageLabeler has a labeled dataset of dust which you may use for your detection model.

SPoRT?

### High Latitude Dust


### Smoke

Smoke from events such as wildfires, volcanoes, and industrial pollution cause numerous health impacts. ImageLabeler has a labeled dataset of smoke which you may use for your detection model.

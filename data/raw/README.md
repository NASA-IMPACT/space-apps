NASA provides a plethora of free data. These data are collected from different sources including but 
not limited to satellites, instruments deployed at various places and in some cases, even manually collected.

Next we will be presenting a few places from where these data can be extracted

**Common Metadata Repository (CMR)**: 
Metadata is information about the actual data. They allow faster data searching and extraction. 
A very close analogy of this would be a video search based on various metadata of that video like 
name of the video, actors starring in the video, and so on.

According to [Earthdata, CMR search](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), CMR is a high-performance, high-quality, continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs Earth Science data and associated service metadata records. These metadata records are registered, modified, discovered, and accessed through programmatic interfaces leveraging standard protocols and APIs

[CMR Search](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) is an API interface that allows the users to make a very customizable search based on different query parameters.
The [API documentation](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html) contains a comprehensive guide on how to use the CMR API.
Some example python scripts of how to use the query can be found in the folder that contains this readme file.

**Earthdata Search**:
[Earthdata search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) enables the user to be able to search for the earthdata collected by NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) over the period of 30 years. The website also contains a comprehensive guide on how to use the website in the [getting started](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/getting-started) and the [learn](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn) section.

In addition to this, Earthdata also allows visualization of the data via [Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/). According to Worldview, it allows the users to visually explore the past and the present of this dynamic planet from a satellite's perspective.

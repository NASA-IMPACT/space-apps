# Phenomena Detection Challenge Resources

This repository provides a list of resources for the phenomena detection challenge, including satellite imagery, labeled data, labeling tools, and example code for imagery downloading, processing, and machine learning. <br>

Selected pre-labeled data is available in the [labeled folder](data/labeled/), or participants may choose to use the resources in the [raw folder](data/raw/) to access a broader range of data and label it themselves or with our included tool ImageLabler. <br>

The [examples](examples/) folder contains example scripts for machine learning, as well as downloading satellite imagery.<br>

Best of luck with the challenge! If you need clarification on challenge details please see contact information in the [resources](resources/) folder.
